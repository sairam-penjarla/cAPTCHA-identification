# CAPTCHA Recognition with Deep Learning

This project is a web application for recognizing CAPTCHA images using a pre-trained deep learning model. It uses Flask for the web interface and TensorFlow/Keras for the CAPTCHA recognition.

## Features

- Upload a CAPTCHA image and get the recognized text.
- Simple and easy-to-use web interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Pillow
- TensorFlow/Keras

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sairam-penjarla/cAPTCHA-identification.git
   cd cAPTCHA-identification
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained model and place it in the `model` directory. Ensure the path to the model is correct in the `main.py` file.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the web interface.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the home page.
2. Upload a CAPTCHA image using the provided form.
3. The recognized text will be displayed on the page.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Contains the `IdentifyCaptcha` class for loading the model and predicting the CAPTCHA text.
- `app.py`: Flask application to handle web requests and render the HTML template.
- `templates/upload_image.html`: HTML template for the web interface.
- `samples/`: Directory to store uploaded CAPTCHA images.
- `model/`: Directory to store the pre-trained model.
